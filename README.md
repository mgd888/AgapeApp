## Design Patterns

### Controlled Component Design Pattern

Controlled Components are used all throughout the create and edit screens. It is a pattern in React Native that is commonly used to handle form state. This design pattern works by utilizing states via props. State changes are performed through callbacks; for instance, via an onChangeText or updateState. Values can be modified by having it passed to controlled components as props.

The code snippet below indicates the usage of the controlled component design pattern:

As seen above, the values of the following input fields are modified through the use of the controlled component design pattern. It uses the callbacks such as onChangeText which a value prop is used to update a useState.
